How does AI bring immersion to the games?

“Video games are a great way of training AI algorithms 
because they are designed to give human minds gradual progression into harder and harder challenges.” 
(Luzgin, 2018)

* cutting-edge AI research
* “Two of the core components of commercial game AI are pathfinding and finite state machines,” explains Julian Togelius
* THE GOAL OF MOST AI RESEARCH INVOLVING GAMES IS TO BENCHMARK THE SOFTWARE’S SOPHISTICATION
* Short says that most AI in games is the equivalent of “smoke and mirrors” — just sophisticated enough 
to make you think you’re interacting with something intelligent, 
but controlled and predictable enough to keep everything from going off the rails.
* “You can prioritize the raw computing power or the solution-oriented thinking of the machine or things like that,” 
she adds, “But in games we don’t value that almost at all. 
It’s nice for [research] papers, but what game designers actually want is for players to have a good experience.”
* “Typically when you design the game, you want to design an experience for the player. 
You want to know what the player will experience when he gets to that point in the game. 
And for that, if you’re going to put an AI there, you want the AI to be predictable,” Togelius says.

* ‘OBSTACLE TOWER’ IS A MODERN-DAY ‘MONTEZUMA’S REVENGE’ DESIGNED FOR COMPUTERS TO PLAY
* “A lot of people think that AI is about building better product recommendations at Amazon. 
But at the end of the day, it’s really solving way more complex problems. 
It’s about dealing with vision, control, and other cognitive challenges,” Lange says.

* And as it turns out, curiosity is a very effective motivator when teaching AI to play video games, too.
* The agent starts playing the game random, but learns to improve its strategy through trial and error. - reinforcement learning
* AI CAN BECOME ADDICTED TO RANDOM REWARDS, JUST LIKE HUMANS
* Before they take a certain action they predict what the game will look like afterwards. 
If they guess correctly, chances are they’ve seen this part of the game before. This mechanism is known as “prediction error.”
* The big reason is that curiosity helps computers learn on their own.

* The definition that OpenAI team used for artificial curiosity was relatively simple: 
The algorithm would try to predict what its environment would look like one frame into the future.
