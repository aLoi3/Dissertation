* Self-evaluation (in one of the appecdices)
* Better introduction - what is the purpose of my research and what are the challenges
* Better explain why use Turing's Test
* Use roadmap (what is a roadmap?)
* More reliable sources (AI game programming wisdom)
* Use more sources in particular parts, quotes and own ideas
* Consider other games series as an example
* More specific challenge - move that to the introduction
* Use italics for game names
* Page numbers are required for quotations
* List the hypotheses in a table/diagram
* Computing Artefact should have it's own sections with lifecycle, testing, techniques (with pseudo-code), etc.

- New Paragraphs -
* Life cycle
* Test plan??
* Data management plan
* Data analysis

- Current Sections -
1) Methodology
* How am I doing the group allocation, video allocation and another (randomly is not enough)


elucidation of the problem and the objectives of the project 
an in-depth investigation of the context and literature, and where appropriate, other similar products (this section is likely to be emphasised less for an IEng project) 
where appropriate, a clear description of the stages of the life cycle undertaken 
where appropriate, a description of how verification and validation were applied at these stages
where appropriate, a description of the use of tools to support the development process 
a critical appraisal of the project, indicating the rationale for any design/implementation decisions, lessons learnt during the course of the project, and evaluation 
(with hindsight) of the project outcome and the process of its production (including a review of the plan and any deviations from it)
