Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in certain games making it much more engaging and enjoyable to play. 
However, it's not always a good idea to have unbeatable enemies or allies. 
Thus, I will be discussing AI methods that would make the game more appealing. 

I've long been interested in AI and how developers could improve players' experience using different methods. 
Therefore, I want to research some techniques that could potentially be used in some games to increase immersion and make it more entertaining. 
However, some methods could possible ruin some players' experiences depending on one's desire to play games. 
I have included this possible problem into my potential research questions. 
The following bullet points will briefly tell what general topic I would like to research and the research question itself:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Human-like behaviour in games - does AI that behaves like a human adds immersion and enjoyment to a game?
	\item Human-like behaviour in games - does human-like AI ruins the experience of players that play games to escape from real life?
	\item Reinforcement learning (RL) - could simple RL algorithms be more efficient in some games than complex ones?
	\item AI agents as testers - could AI ease game developers' lives by thoroughly testing a particular system?
\end{itemize}

As for my artefact I would like to try and (1) recreate ("recreate" is a bold statement, but I couldn't think of anything else right now) some 
sort of human-like AI behaviour and test it in a game and thus have a survey; (2) Have no idea about the artefact for this topic; 
(3) A/B test the open-sourced algorithms on different types of games using simple and complex learning algorithms; 
(4) create an AI that would test some system in a game, potentially in a team project game.
