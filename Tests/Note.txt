First automation test were successful, however, by observing it, I noticed that when the agent interacts with the object, the object does not zoom towards the agent. 
Therefore, I need to test whether the object zooms in and out as well. Also, from observing, it felt like the interactable object did not highlight. Possibly, due to 
inaccurate camera position as it is rotated with agent's head.

Fixed:
* Object zoom was fixed - apparently, the timeline I used for smooth zoom in/out was broken or deleted (from inside).

Side Notes:
* Highlight for AI does work, however, as I mentioned before, due to camera's inaccuracy, the object is not highlighted even when being looked at.
* Separate maps for different tests.
