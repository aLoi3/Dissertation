Find a small nuance to apply for AI that might make the AI behave like human would in a game
-> Exploration behaviour
-> Player when first play a game will most likely explore as much as they can in the beginning - environment, surroundings, asset details, texture details, etc.
-> Use template-based behaviour? with modified exploration behaviour and show that to a person asking whether they can say which one is human, which one is 
template-based behaviour and which one is my modified behaviour.
-> Record each behaviour and show participants 2 of these - player and base behaviour | player and modified behaviour
-> Use our game with changed camera view to first person and add the AI to test
