\section{250-word Proposal}
Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in certain games making it much more engaging and enjoyable to play. However, it's not always a good idea to have unbeatable enemies or allies. Thus, I will be discussing AI methods that would make the game more appealing. 

I've long been interested in AI and how developers could improve players' experience using different methods. Therefore, I want to research some techniques that could potentially be used in some games to increase immersion and make it more entertaining. However, some methods could possible ruin some players' experiences depending on one's desire to play games. I have included this possible problem into my potential research questions. The following bullet points will briefly tell what general topic I would like to research and the research question itself:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Human-like behaviour in games - does AI that behaves like a human adds immersion and enjoyment to a game?
	\item Human-like behaviour in games - does human-like AI ruins the experience of players that play games to escape from real life?
	\item Reinforcement learning (RL) - could simple RL algorithms be more efficient in some games than complex ones?
	\item AI agents as testers - could AI ease game developers' lives by thoroughly testing a particular system?
\end{itemize}

As for my artefact I would like to try and (1) recreate ("recreate" is a bold statement, but I couldn't think of anything else right now) some sort of human-like AI behaviour and test it in a game and thus have a survey; (2) Have no idea about the artefact for this topic; (3) A/B test the open-sourced algorithms on different types of games using simple and complex learning algorithms; (4) create an AI that would test some system in a game, potentially in a team project game.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{A}{rtificial} intelligence (AI) in video games is very crucial when it's used as one of the main mechanics. Intelligent non-player characters (NPCs) are extremely hard to make due to the nature of it's complexity. The more complex it is the more outcomes developers will have to consider and the more problems will occur during development. 

Explain curiosity - human behaviour often depends on person's intensions to explore. Why apply to AI? The aim of this paper is not to create curiosity-driven AI in Unreal Engine 4 (UE4), but to implement and test a particular behaviour and see how people react. Whether they like it or not, whether they think is behaves smart and etc. The aim of this implementation is to find a small nuance that can make the AI feel smarter.

\section{Related Work}
Will be using my third year team project game to test the implementation on.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Explain the main focus of this paper
	\item Explain the testing subject I'm gonna use
	\item Briefly explain next sections
\end{itemize}

\section{AI Evolution}
Different methods that are used in AI learning - reinforcement, evolution-based, q-learning, etc. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Why is it complex and important?
	\item What does it help to achieve? 
	\item 
\end{itemize}

\section{Curiosity}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Why do curiosity?
	\item Examples of curiosity-driven behaviours
	\item How will it make AI look smarter?
	\item Challenges that occur trying to implement such behaviour
	\item Explain why curiousity is one of the main drivers that lead human to explore/do something
\end{itemize}

\section{Turing's Test}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Explain Turing's test
	\item Why use this testing method?
	\item Explain how I'm gonna test my implementation
	\item Briefly go over what question I'm going to use to get the participants' data
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
\end{itemize}

\section{Hypotheses}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The AI will feel smarter
	\item The participants won't notice the difference
	\item The participants won't distinguish human's behaviour and AI
\end{itemize}
